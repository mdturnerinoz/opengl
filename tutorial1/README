This series of files represents my efforts to understand OpenGL using a (qutie good) tutorial found at http://www.videotutorialsrock.com/index.php.

All technical (i.e. OpenGL) content is from the presentation; I can take absolutely no credit for any of it per se. I have made the following changes so it would be more portable using git:

1. Created a git repository at the top of the tree.
2. Embellished the each makefile so that it's more easily used from a top-level makefile.
3. Added a top-level makefile.
4. Added a  "#include <string.h>" file to a couple of the main.cpp files because GCC returned an error on my Linux system (I tested on Mandriva Linux 2010.2 and Mac OS X 10.6).

I plan further enhancements to this project as I get more time and a better understanding of OpenGL.

Thanks to the author of the tutorial ntoed above as it's the first one I've found that really helped me understand how start using OpenGL (albeit through GLUT).

Building the Code

After doing a git clone of the project, you can perform a make (all implied) at the top level of the tutorial (./Tutorial1). The top-level make targets and project struct is as follows:

SUBDIRS = setup Part1/Lesson1 Part1/Lesson2 Part1/Lesson3 Part1/Lesson4 Part1/Lesson5 Part1/Lesson6 \
                Part2/Lesson7 Part2/Lesson8 Part2/Lesson9 Part2/Lesson10 Part2/Lesson11             \
                Part3/Lesson12 Part3/Lesson13 Part3/Lesson14 Part3/Lesson15                         \
                Part4/Lesson16 Part4/Lesson17 Part4/Lesson18 Part4/Lesson19 Part4/Lesson20          \
                Part5/Lesson21

all:   Build the entire project (you can also cd to a partiuclar directory to focus on running it etc.)

clean: Clean up all executables/junk etc.

list:  List (ls) the contents of all projects.
